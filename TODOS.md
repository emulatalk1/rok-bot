# TODOS

Items deferred from planning sessions. Each entry should be self-contained enough that picking it up months later is feasible.

## ✅ DONE — BetterDisplay setup automation

**Resolved 2026-05-06** via `docs/setup.md` (commit `f8ba718`). Covers Mode 1 (zero
setup), Mode 2 (BetterDisplay walkthrough + Stop-and-output trick), troubleshooting,
and alternative non-BD displays (HDMI dummy plug, Sidecar). Originally specced as
P1.

## P1: Migrate from `screencapturekit` Rust crate to `objc2-screen-capture-kit`

**Source:** P2 spike build failure 2026-05-06
**Effort:** human ~half day / CC ~1 hour
**Depends on:** v0.1 implementation phase

The `screencapturekit` Rust crate (1.5.x) wraps an internal Swift package via `swift-bridge`. The build script invokes `xcrun --sdk macosx --show-sdk-platform-path`, which fails on machines with only Xcode Command Line Tools installed (full Xcode required). This makes the dep a hard install-time blocker for any contributor without ~14 GB of Xcode.

`objc2-screen-capture-kit` (0.3.x) is the canonical alternative — direct ObjC2 message-passing bindings, no Swift bridge, no Xcode requirement. v0.1 should use it from day one.

Until then, the spike at `spikes/p2-spike/run.sh` shells out to Apple's `screencapture -l <wid>` CLI for capture, which works fine for verification but is not appropriate for v0.1 (subprocess overhead per frame).

## P2: v0.2 — Mode 2 lifecycle (deferred from /plan-eng-review 2026-05-07)

**Source:** /plan-eng-review of `~/.gstack/projects/emulatalk1-rok-bot/hbchuc-main-design-20260506-202938.md`
**Effort:** human ~1 day / CC ~2 hours
**Depends on:** v0.1 Mode 1 binary shipped (cargo init + window.rs + display.rs + main.rs visible-mode)

The two-mode runtime contract design splits into two milestones per Codex tension review:

- **v0.1 (this PR):** Mode 1 only — RoK on primary, bot runs visibly. NO shortcuts module, NO lifecycle module, NO panic hook, NO state file. Smallest path to a working `cargo run`. Ships in days.
- **v0.2 (this TODO):** Mode 2 lifecycle. Adds:
  - `src/shortcuts.rs` with a `Shortcuts` trait + `SystemShortcuts` impl (shells out to `shortcuts list` / `shortcuts run`). `wait-timeout` crate for 5s subprocess timeout. `MockShortcuts` for tests.
  - `src/lifecycle.rs` with `LifecycleGuard` (RAII Drop), `std::panic::set_hook`, `ctrlc::set_handler`. Static `OnceLock<Arc<Mutex<LifecycleState>>>` for `connected_by_us` + `already_disconnected` dedup. 500ms drop-detection thread tolerating 3 consecutive errors before canceling.
  - **State file `~/.rok-bot/last-mode`** — written `mode2` on Mode 2 clean exit, deleted on Mode 1 exit. Boot logic: if file says `mode2` AND RoK on primary, force cold-path connect (per Codex tension 1, prevents mode-signal pollution after a clean disconnect).
  - Cold/warm path branches in `src/main.rs`.
  - Full unit test coverage via the trait seam.

**Why split:** Codex review surfaced that designing RAII + signal handling before there's a minimal visible bot is wasted motion. Get something working, then add the magic.

**Reference:** the pre-split design is in `~/.gstack/projects/emulatalk1-rok-bot/hbchuc-main-design-20260506-202938.md`. Eng review decisions logged in this branch's review jsonl.

## P2: v0.1 TCC permissions preflight (deferred from /plan-eng-review 2026-05-07)

**Source:** /plan-eng-review codex tension 4 (TCC permissions missing from setup)
**Effort:** human ~2 hours / CC ~20 min
**Depends on:** v0.1 hello-world clicks landed (Accessibility check needs CGEvent.post in scope)

The bot needs Screen Recording (for capture) and Accessibility (for synthetic input via `CGEvent.post`). First-run failures from missing permissions look like cryptic data corruption — `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` returns titles as `nil`, `CGEvent.post` silently no-ops.

**Work:**
1. Update `docs/setup.md` with a TCC section: "After install, grant **Screen Recording** AND **Accessibility** to your terminal app (Terminal.app, iTerm2, etc.) when macOS prompts. Both are required."
2. Implement preflight in `src/main.rs` startup:
   - Screen Recording check: call `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo([.optionAll], kCGNullWindowID)`, scan results for any non-bot window where `kCGWindowName` is non-nil. If ALL titles are nil, Screen Recording is denied → exit `PermissionsMissing { which: "Screen Recording" }`.
   - Accessibility check: call `CGEventSourceKeyState(.combinedSessionState, .keyA)` (read-only) — returns `false` consistently if Accessibility denied vs flickering with real keyboard state if granted. Or simpler: just inject a no-op CGEvent and check `CGRequestPostEventAccess()` returns true.
3. Both checks ship the same `PermissionsMissing` error variant in the `BotError` enum.

## P3: Multi-instance feasibility (the "farm" 10x dream)

**Source:** office-hours D7 (P1 in the original premise list)
**Effort:** human ~1 hour spike / CC ~15 min
**Depends on:** v0.1 hello-world working

The autonomous-twin → multi-account-farm path requires running multiple RoK instances on a single Mac. Mac App Store's iOS-on-Mac runtime may enforce single-instance per bundle ID, in which case the farm vision needs separate Macs / VMs / remote machines.

**Cheapest verification when ready:** launch RoK twice via `open -na /Applications/RiseOfKingdoms.app` (or whatever the actual install path is) and observe whether two distinct processes survive, or whether the second invocation just brings the first to focus.

If multi-instance works, the v0.1 architecture (single binary, single account) refactors to a coordinator + per-account workers. If multi-instance is blocked, the farm dream needs additional Macs or BetterDisplay virtual-display arrangements per Mac.
